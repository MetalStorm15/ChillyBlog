## July

### Tue, 6th
Long since, I have noticed my lack of English writing skills, that I have a restricted active vocabulary compared to passive one. And I have also tried to deal with the matter since ago but little progress has been made mainly because of my indiscipline and absence of effective training methods. Furthermore, I did’t have a practical way of seeking the correct expressions of particular ideas, which has been alleviated since buying some dictionaries but haven’t been resolved until nowadays the vocation has begun and I can search on the Internet.

So I’ll begin to practice writing in English and it’s the first day today. I plan to write something everyday, even just a sentence.

I resume to keep diaries (in Chinese) this afternoon since the last time roughly a month ago. Because my old diary book is filled, I bought a new one which stand for a start of a new epoch in my life. In this entry I write down a list of tasks which I think is necessary for myself. To show my resolution, I learned some lessons of *Mastering American Accent* for the first time since I bought it and at present keep a diary in English. However, I do not have much self-discipline, not executing this plan well, that I did not do all the tasks. The long distance have to be covered step by step, so I should begin with three tasks which I considered as the most consequential and then increase gradually.

### Wen, 8th

Yesterday, 7th July, I didn't keep anyting in my English diary and I almost learned nothing except reading some pages of *the Lord of the Rings*. I didn't practice handwriting and read Ancient Chinese literature, which I consider as the things of the most importance. Plainly, I am not a disciplined learner. 

I have to admit the fact of my lack of willpower, and it's also true that I should not be too self-critical, which will not be conducive to my further evolution. It's in my nature and I have to accept it or I will get punishment given by god (or sky in Chinese expression).

To resolve a problem completely, it is the first step to admit and accept the fact. If people are unlikely to affect the nonexistance, then, a fotiori, people could not remedy a problem which they refused to concede.

So I know I am disciplined now, and I do not think it is shame, moreover, I do not think it's a fault to have disadvantages. The world is so critical that people should not express or even have any cowardliness and sorrow. We are all forced to be strong and positive and the negative emotions are disgraceful.

The fucking world!
