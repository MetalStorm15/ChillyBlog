</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Long since, I have noticed my lack of English writing skills, that I have a restricted active vocabulary compared to passive one. And I have also tried to deal with the matter since ago but little progress has been made mainly because of my indiscipline and absence of effective training methods. Furthermore, I did’t have a practical way of seeking the correct expressions of particular ideas, which has been alleviated since buying some dictionaries but haven’t been resolved until nowadays the vocation has begun and I can search on the Internet.</p>
<p>So I’ll begin to practice writing in English and it’s the first day today. I plan to write something everyday, even just a sentence.</p>
<p>I resume to keep diaries (in Chinese) this afternoon since the last time roughly a month ago. Because my old diary book is filled, I bought a new one which stand for a start of a new epoch in my life. In this entry I write down a list of tasks which I think is necessary for myself. To show my resolution, I learned some lessons of <em>Mastering American Accent</em> for the first time since I bought it and at present keep a diary in English. However, I do not have much self-discipline, not executing this plan well, that I did not do all the tasks. The long distance have to be covered step by step, so I should begin with three tasks which I considered as the most consequential and then increase gradually.</p>
